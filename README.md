# engine.EasyRegex Introduction
 Regex Expression is a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation. It allows you to define a pattern, which is a sequence of characters, and then search for, match, or manipulate text based on that pattern. Regex could be very complicated, confused for beginners. `engine.EasyRegex` helps to create and verify the regex pattern.
 Maven is the dependencies management tool for the project.
